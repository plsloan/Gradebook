### Home Page (Current Semester)

Simply double click a course to view it and add grades.


### Semester View

Here, you can create semester objects that can store courses. When the "Current Semester" button is clicked, it becomes the new current semester and will be displayed on the home page. 

Again, you can double click to view a course. 


### Add Course

The only clarification that may be needed here is the "Grade Categories" indicates the types of grades that will be stored, such as exams, projects, and papers.


### View Course

This gradebook was developed based on Liberty University's point system rather than a percentage based system. The points are calculated out of 1,000 points

+ 900 points = 90% = A
+ 800 points = 80% = B
+ 700 points = 70% = C


### GPA Calculator

This page allows the user to be able to calculate their future GPA based on expected outcomes of their courses. When the points and credits columns are altered, the new GPA is recalculated.
